# Spring Boot Back-End Modernization

Author: Cassandra Beauchamp

Project description: Create a new back-end system with Spring framwork to modernize an outdated back-end. Use REST services with JPA and a SQL database. Allow for a checkout service to save carts in the SQL databse. Enforce input validation. 

Important notes: This project will not run, as we do not have access to the angular frontend or the SQL database. However you can see Screenshorts.pdf to get an idea of how the backend worked with the frontend and saving things to the SQL databse.
